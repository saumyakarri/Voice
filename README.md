This project comprises a simple web app (made using HTML and CSS in frontend and Python Flask in backend) that captures images from the users webcam and uses the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm to detect among pretrained weights of 80 common objects in the frame and gives audio output in either of the 10 vernacular language chosen, in real time.
